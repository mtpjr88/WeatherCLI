# Weather Application CLI

This CLI Application will display the temperature of the location you type. If no location is entered it will determine locatoin based on IP address.

This is a node js application.

Must have node js installed to run.

I used 'Open Weather Map' API.


To Use:
 Open terminal or command prompt in directory file 
 run app.js -l your location 
 ie. " app.js -l Modesto,California "
